# phase-reduction-for-aEIF-neurons

Matlab implementation to compute the limit cycle trajectory and infinitesimal phase response curve for an oscillating adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire neuron, as well as the interaction function between two identical neurons coupled through a conductance-based synapse model. The phase response curve is calculated using the adjoint method described in: __Ladenbauer, Augustin, Shiau, Obermayer,__ ___Impact of adaptation currents on synchronization of coupled exponential integrate-and-fire neurons,___ __[PLOS Computational Biology 2012](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002478)__
